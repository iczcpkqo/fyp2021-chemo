* Learning Chemotactic Strategie
** Gobbler Notes
- Simple 2D particle simulator
- no learning
- small length scale
- odor particles are emitted from a stationary point source
- by poison process (with limit of one particle / time step)
- particles have drift plus Brownian motion
- agent is rectangle divided into four sensory quadrants
- agent moves in direction of quadrant with max particle count (each timestep)
- √dt in code are because variances are additive but scale factors are standard deviations, so this keeps the dynamics consistent as dt is changed
- the robot is hard-limited by the edges of the arena
- odor particles are removed if they hit the edge of the arena
- odor particles are stochastically absorbed (removed) when on the agent
*** Things that really should be fixed or done
- Emission should use true Poisson process, so >1 particle can be emitted in one time step
- Option to terminate simulation when agent gets close to source, or after some timeout
- Make plots of distribution of time to get to source as function of various parameters
